## History
This java program generates [bolsinga.com](http://www.bolsinga.com/). It is a collection of code I've been working on since sometime in 1998 (or earlier).

It all started because at first I just saved tickets from shows I'd gone to (and I still have them all). Then I wrote down the shows I saw during college, many which didn't have tickets to actually save. I tracked each show on notebook papers, as well as in my University of Illinois i-Book. This was a daily planner type of thing for students.

At some point in the mid 1990s I started entering this information into a computer text file. Sometime after that, I realized I could write a program to read that file and have it tell me what band I had seen most often. It's not clear to me when I started the program. The `git` history starts in 2002, which was when the `cvs2svn` history was imported into `git`. However the [first entry](http://www.bolsinga.com/archives/1998.html#e0) is from 9/6/1998. That is when I was living in Austin, TX working for Metrowerks on java tools. Therefore I'd guess it was sometime in 1997.

It started as a program written using Metrowerks Codewarrior C++. At the time I loved C++. I read Bjarne Stroustrup's 2nd and 3rd editions of "The C++ Programming Language" cover to cover. Eventually (read the industry insider [details](http://www.bolsinga.com/archives/2005.html#e171)) I migrated this code to use Project Builder and gcc, also C++. I still have this source code around, but it is no longer used.

In about 2003 I started a rewrite of the program in java. It provided a way for me to code in what seemed the simplest way to get this type of program done at the time. I really wanted to use XML! I wanted to use threads. Java had support for these built-in, and C++ (at the time) did not. The site generated by the java program finally debuted in May 2003. It never really used XML as part of its core, but depended upon it for its implementation until 2020.

## Parts

### Diary
A Diary consists of Entries. Entries have a timestamp, an optional title, and a comment. It supports new lines, and no other markup.

### Shows
A Show consists of a list of artists, listed in headliner to opener order. It has a date, which may have any portion (month, day, or year) denoted as unknown. It has a venue name. It also has an optional comment about the show.

Venues have additional information, such as the URL and the address. This allows the site to be generated to calcuate how many shows have been seen in each city.

### iTunes
iTunes data is obtained from the iTunes program running on a mac. This data is used to add to the pages for artists. It will have all of their albums with release dates and song listings.

### Details

All items can contain external links or internal links. The internal links can be hand built with a `@@ROOT_URL@@` root. There is also an encoder that runs across all the artist names and venue names. It will look at all the text and automatically generate links to a matching band or venue.

Artists and venues can be related to each other, for any reason. Artists are sorted using iTunes sorting rules, and there is an additional data file for sorting artists not in iTunes (for artists only seen at shows).

The file formats for all of these data inputs are arbitrary and different for each file type. It basically depended upon was found to be simplest (or most interesting to try) at the time.
